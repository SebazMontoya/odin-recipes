    <h2>"Dang, I could eat 15 of these."</h2>
    <p>Take it from our Test Kitchen: Sweet Chili Popcorn Chicken is, quite literally, a “party in your mouth.” Each bite is coated in a toasted coconut-panko breading that’s irresistibly crunchy and slightly sweet, perfectly balanced by a sticky-sweet chili glaze. And the kicker? They’re baked—not fried—but you’d never guess it from the delicious texture.</p>
    <p>Sticky, crispy, tender, and downright addictive, this dish is one you’ll be reaching for again and again. As recipe taster Liz Mervosh shared, “Dang, I could eat 15 of these.”</p>
