    <p>“The cream cheese brings out a rich and creamy flavor while the pasta sauce gives it a real zing,” according to Lucky. “One thing I did differently is that I mixed my pasta noodles in with the cream cheese, cottage cheese, and sour cream. This is a delightful dish that can feed a small family or a large gathering! It's definitely my go-to meal!”</p>
    <p>“I also like to add a sprinkle of fresh parsley or basil on top for a burst of freshness,” Lucky adds. “Sometimes, I even experiment with adding a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat. This recipe is so versatile and forgiving, you can easily adapt it to suit your taste preferences or dietary needs. It's always a hit at potlucks and family dinners!”</p>
